[Julia](https://julialang.org) is a high-level, [high-performance](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) dynamic language for technical computing. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for [multiple platforms](https://julialang.org/downloads/#support_tiers) via LLVM.

[JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/) contains over 4,000 Julia packages for use by the community.

## Julia Tools, Libraries and Frameworks

[JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html) is a free and fast way to setup Julia for individual researchers, engineers, scientists, quants, traders, economists, students and others. Julia developers can build better software quicker and easier while benefiting from Julia's unparalleled high performance. It includes 2600+ open source packages or from a curated list of 250+ JuliaPro packages. Curated packages are tested, documented and supported by Julia Computing.

[Juno](https://junolab.org) is a powerful, free IDE based on [Atom](https://atom.io/) for the Julia language.

[Debugger.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl) is the Julia debuggin tool.

[Profile (Stdlib)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/profile/) is a module provides tools to help developers improve the performance of their code. When used, it takes measurements on running code, and produces output that helps you understand how much time is spent on individual line's.

[Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) allows you to modify code and use the changes without restarting Julia. With Revise, you can be in the middle of a session and then update packages, switch git branches, and/or edit the source code in the editor of your choice; any changes will typically be incorporated into the very next command you issue from the REPL. This can save you the overhead of restarting Julia, loading packages, and waiting for code to JIT-compile.

[JuliaGPU](https://juliagpu.org/) is a Github organization created to unify the many packages for programming GPUs in Julia. With its high-level syntax and flexible compiler, Julia is well positioned to productively program hardware accelerators like GPUs without sacrificing performance.

[IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) is the Julia kernel for Jupyter.

[AWS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl) is a Julia interface for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

[CUDA.jl](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl) is a package for the main programming interface for working with NVIDIA CUDA GPUs using Julia. It features a user-friendly array abstraction, a compiler for writing CUDA kernels in Julia, and wrappers for various CUDA libraries.

[XLA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTPU/XLA.jl) is a package for compiling Julia to XLA for [Tensor Processing Unit(TPU)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/).

[Nanosoldier.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/Nanosoldier.jl) is a package for running JuliaCI services on MIT's Nanosoldier cluster.

[Julia for VSCode](https://www.julia-vscode.org) is a powerful extension for the Julia language.

[JuMP.jl](https://jump.dev/) is a domain-specific modeling language for [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) embedded in Julia.

[Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl) is a univariate and multivariate optimization in Julia.

[RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl) is a package that allows you to call R functions from Julia.

[JavaCall.jl](http://juliainterop.github.io/JavaCall.jl) is a package that allows you to call Java functions from Julia.

[PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) is a package that allows you to call Python functions from Julia.

[MXNet.jl](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl) is the Apache MXNet Julia package. MXNet.jl brings flexible and efficient GPU computing and state-of-art deep learning to Julia.

[Knet](https://denizyuret.github.io/Knet.jl/latest) is the [KoÃ§ University deep](http://www.ku.edu.tr/en) learning framework implemented in Julia by [Deniz Yuret](https://www.denizyuret.com/) and collaborators. It supports GPU operation and automatic differentiation using dynamic computational graphs for models defined in plain Julia.

[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) is a Julia package for probability distributions and associated functions.

[DataFrames.jl](http://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/) is a tool for working with tabular data in Julia.

[Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/) is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support.

[IRTools.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/IRTools.jl) is a simple and flexible IR format, expressive enough to work with both lowered and typed Julia code, as well as external IRs.

[Cassette.jl](https://github.com/jrevels/Cassette.jl) is a Julia package that provides a mechanism for dynamically injecting code transformation passes into Juliaâ€™s just-in-time (JIT) compilation cycle, enabling post hoc analysis and modification of "Cassette-unaware" Julia programs without requiring manual source annotation or refactoring of the target code.
